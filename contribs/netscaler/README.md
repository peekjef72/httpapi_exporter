## Description

Prometheus exporter for Netscaler (CITRIX ADC)

This exporter collect metrics from netscaler HTTP REST API.

It uses httpapi_exporter that exposes metrics to http (default port 9258) that can be then scrapped by Prometheus.

This exporter was originally inspired from [citrix-adc-metrics-exporter](citrix/citrix-adc-metrics-exporter/), and has generated a python version [netscaler_exporter](peekjef72/netscaler_exporter).

It is an usage in "my company" and doesn't collect every feature exposed by netscaler HTTP API, but it can be expanded as desired: updates and contributions are welcome.

It allows you to collect several netscalers by adding them to the YAML config files and then specifying a target parameter in Prometheus configuration. It benefits all features from httpapi_exporter : targets, models, auth and proxies.

**Config**: [see etc/config.yml](etc/netscaler/config.yml)

## Usage

I recommend to create a unix symbolic link from httpapi_exporter to netscaler_exporter so it is easy to distinguish in processes tree (top, ps)

```shell
ln -s httpapi_exporter netscaler_exporter
```

To start the exporter you just have to start with a path to config file:

```shell
netscaler_exporter -c /etc/httpapi_exporter/netscaler/config.yml
```

## exporter command line options

to start the exporter:

```shell
./netscaler_exporter &
```

By default, it will load the file config.yml to perform action.

```

</details>

To test your configuration you can launch the exporter in dry_mode:

```shell
./netscaler_exporter --log.level=debug -n -t host.domain
```

This command will try to connect to the 'host.domain' netscaler with parameters specified in config.yml, exposes the collected metrics, and eventually the warning or errors, then exits.

## Prometheus config

The exporter can act as a remote collector so that several netscalers can be collected, Prometheus addresses each server by adding a target
 parameter in the url. The "target" must be the same (lexically) that in exporter config file.

```yaml
  - job_name: "citrix_netscaler"
    scrape_interval: 30s
    scrape_timeout: 20s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets: [ netscalerhost.domain ]
        labels:
          environment: "PROD"
      - targets: [ netscalerhost2.domain]
        labels:
          environment: "PROD"

#    file_sd_configs:
#      - files: [ "/etc/prometheus/citrix_exp/*.yml" ]
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: "netscaler-exporter-hostname.domain:9258"  # The netscaler exporter's real hostname.
```

## Metrics

The collected metrics are defined in separated files positioned in the folder conf/metrics.
All values, computations, labels are defined in the metrics files, meaning that the exporter does nothing internally on values. The configuration files fully drive how values are collected and rendered.

### Currently collected metrics are

All metrics are defined in the configuration files (conf/metrics/*.yml). You can retrieve all metric names here. Most of them have help text too.

 STATS | NS nitro name
------ | -------------
LB vserver stats | "lbvserver"
HTTP stats | "protocolhttp"
TCP stats | "protocoltcp"
UDP stats | "protocoludp"
IP stats | "protocolip"
Interface stats | "Interface" (capital 'i')
Service stats | "service"
Service group stats | "services"
Bandwidth Capacity stats | "nscapacity"
SSL stats | "ssl"
SSL Certificates stats | "sslcertkey"
SSL vserver stats | "sslvserver"
System info stats | "system"
System memory stats | "systemmemory"
System cpu stats | "systemcpu"
High Availability stats | "hanode"
AAA stats | "aaa"
citrixadc_up | "1" if login is successful, else "0"

## Extending metrics

***MUST be reviewed: old python version of doc !***

Exported metrics, are defined in the YAML config files. The value can use Jinja2 templating language. The format of the configuration is inspired from Ansible tasks representation.
So a metric configuration file, consists in a list of actions to perform.

There are five possible actions:

- url: to collect metrics from HTTP API
- set_fact: to assign value to variables
- actions: to perform a list of (sub-)actions
- metrics: to define metrics to expose/return to Prometheus
- debug: to display debug text to logger.

All actions have default "attributes":

- name: the name of action or metric counter for metrics action.
- vars: to set vars to global symbols' table.
- with_items: to loop on current action with a list of items.
- loop_var: to set the name of the variable that will receive the current value in the loop. Default is 'item'.
- when: a list of condition (and) that must be check and be true to perform the action.

The "attributes" are analyzed in the order specified in previous table; it means that you can't use "item" var (obtained from 'with_items' directive) in the vars section because it is not yet defined when the 'vars' section is evaluated. If you need that feature, you will have to consider 'with_items' in an 'actions' section (see metrics/backup_jobs_sessions_metrics.yml).

action | parameter | description | remark
------ | ----------- | ------ | ------
url | &nbsp; |a string that's representing the entity to collect without '/nitro/v1' | http\://host.domain:port/nitro/v1**[url]**. e.g.: /stat/system
 &nbsp; | var_name |the name of the variable to store the results. Default is '_root' meaning that the resulting JSON object is directly store in symbols table. | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;
 set_fact | &nbsp; | list of variable to define | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | var_name: value| &nbsp; | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;
metrics | &nbsp; | define the list of metrics to expose | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | metric_prefix | a prefix to add to all metric name | final name will be [metric_prefix]_[metric_name]
 'a metric' | name | the name of the metric | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | help | the help message added to the metric (and displayed in grafana explorer) | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | type 'gauge' or 'counter' | the type of the prometheus metric | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | value | the numeric value itself | &nbsp;
 &nbsp; | labels | a list of name value pairs to qualify the metric | &nbsp;

A metric configuration file is so at minimum, an action containing list of two actions, one for collecting values on netscaler with 'url', one to define the resulting metric for prometheus with 'metrics':

example:

```yaml
---
- name: my_custom_metric
  actions:
    # first action
    - name: collect elements
      query:
        url: /stat/system
        var_name: results
        # debug: true

    # second action
    - name: proceed elements
      metric_prefix: citrixadc_custmetric
      scope: results.system
      metrics:
        - metric_name: cpu_count
          help: number of cpu for appliance (constant)
          type: gauge
          values:
            _: numcpus

... 
```
